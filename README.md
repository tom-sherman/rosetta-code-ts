# Rosetta Code: Typescript

My solutions to Rosetta Code tasks using Typescript.

```bash
# Install Typesctipt, Jest, and Babel
npm i
# Check solutions by running tests
npm t
```

## Running the solutions

Most tasks are covered by their tests alone but some also have a `runner.ts` file which will show the solution output in the console.

You can run these using `ts-node`:

```
npx ts-node ./tasks/minimal-steps-down-to-1/runner.ts
```
